saying "whats a moth" or anything similar will make skybot say
"A "moth" is a new player. They have brown wings, they flap around uncontrollably, and they are drawn to flame!"
saying anything to beta outside beta channels will make skybot say
"Please, @lorem ispum, do not discuss Sky Beta outside the beta channels :SkyBow:"                                     
sometimes, skybot on beta channels will say
":SkyWave: Welcome to beta-screenshots-videos! 
ðŸ“¸ Share your Beta screenshots, videos, fan art, memes and other media here!

A few reminders:
:skybubble: Please take any chatter and questions to beta-testing-discussionâ€” You may mention (@â€‹) someone there if you'd like to talk about something they shared. Continued chatter may be deleted so images arenâ€™t buried. 
:SkyBeta: For screenshots or other media about Live content or any Live announcements, please use the Live channels such as screenshots-and-videos instead. 
ðŸ“Œ Check out the pinned messages for additional guidelines!
